Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

Problem Type: Binary Classification

Description:
Built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation port.

Steps Performed:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model training using Logistic Regression
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Accuracy Achieved: ~80%


Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

Problem Type: Regression

Description:
Developed a regression model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, lead actor, and number of votes using an Indian movies dataset.

Steps Performed:
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical features
Feature selection
Model training using Linear Regression
Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score
Visualization of actual vs predicted ratings

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression


Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

Problem Type: Multi-class Classification

Description:
